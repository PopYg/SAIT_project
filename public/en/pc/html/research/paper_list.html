						Recognition technology analyzes any type of media (sound, video, text, etc.) to classify their identities of targets (humans or objects), perceive its intrinsic attributes, and understand the context. With massive amounts of data and computational power, recognition technology is making significant improvements on empowering machines to human-level understand. Machines now can recognize objects and translate speech in real-time. Now, recognition technology is extending its application to future technologies such as autonomous cars and drones, visual recognition based e-commerce, intelligent agents, and robots.

						Visual Recognition technology is information processing concerning colors, contours and brightness contrasts that allow recognition of shapes, relationship among shapes and so on. Its technology remains a challenging task for machines. This difficulty stems from the large pattern variations where recognition systems must operate. Meanwhile, the recognition task for human is quite easy due to the deep neural architecture employed by human visual systems. Recently introduced deep neural networks (DNNs) are argued to have a great potential to reach human-level accuracy in recognizing a larger variety of visual patterns because they are considered biologically plausible. Its work has exhibited impressive results in facial recognition, object recognition, and much more.

						Voice Recognition technology captures human voice signal and extracts useful information such as the identity of the speaker, physical and emotional status of the speaker, and the textual contents of the speaker. The last part is called automatic speech recognition (ASR). ASR has been used in limited areas such as interactive voice response (IVR) system, where users use banking or customer service system by voice. In the beginning, ASR was limited to recognize number digits and a few pre-defined command texts but with the technical development, large vocabulary of more than million different words can be recognized. From around 2010, smartphones have been equipped with ASR capabilities to enable users operate them by voice. Around 2010, Deep Learning has brought breakthrough of ASR performance compared to traditional statistical methods of ASR. More and more devices such as wearable devices and internet of things devices will be able to interact with people by voice through advancement of ASR.

					<p class="js-scr-box">SAIT is working on developing various innovative visual recognition algorithms to achieve the near human-level accuracy for smarter usability and intelligent interfaces in smart devices and next generation products. Specific research areas include facial recognition, object recognition, next-generation biometrics and scene understanding. SAIT is also developing deep learning algorithms for high performance and noise robust ASR engine. SAIT applied deep learning in acoustic model (finding phonetic patterns from voice signal) and language model (finding relationships between consecutive words). SAIT’s next generation ASR engine achieved state of the art performance with real life speech data.</p>
