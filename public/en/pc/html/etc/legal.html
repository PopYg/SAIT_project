					<h5>Information Collected </h5>
					<p>
						You can visit this web site without providing us with your personal information. Our web server collects the domain names, not the e-mail address itself, of visitors. Our web server also seeks (as many Web sites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive disk, which allows the server to recognize the computer when it connects to our web server again, in order to enhance your web experience. This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any other personal data, and the information obtained is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our web site promotion. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you may set your browser to reject them or to alert you before it is installed.
						<br><br>
						In addition, there are portions of this Web site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone/fax number, e-mail address, or IP address (an IP address identifies the type of browser you are using, such as Netscape or Internet Explorer, by assigning a unique number) for general system administration to serve you better by diagnosing problems with our server.
